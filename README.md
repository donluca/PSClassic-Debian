Installer for Debian on the Sony Playstation Classic

Use with care and be prepared for the worst (having your Playstation Classic with no games because a part of the script failed in stopping the installer process when something has gone wrong).

Click the "Download Source Code" and unpack its contents in a USB Drive with at least 20GB of free space, formatted to FAT32 and labelled SONY

Turn on your Playstation Classic, wait for it to boot to the main screen and then plug your USB drive.
The process is long (might take more than an hour depending on how fast your USB drive is), so make sure you have time because you don't want to stop the installer while it's doing its thing.
